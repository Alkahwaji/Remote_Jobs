# Remote_Jobs

### What

A list of websites to find remote dev jobs.

I'll keep updating the list as I try new ones.

### Why

I'm making this list because I found the process of looking for a remote job to be inefficient and tedious, so this might help me and potentially other people to do this in a better way.

Feel free to suggest new ones with pull requests.

## List

#### High tier

* [angel.co](https://angel.co/): It's mostly startups, so many of them offer only equity, but there are some that offer money. There are many jobs, the search filters are good, and it's easy to apply, meaning the response rate is not bad, so it's one of the best sites I've tried so far.

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?sort=i&r=true) With remote check enabled. There aren't many job posts usually, but the jobs tend to be of higher quality.

* [authenticjobs](https://www.authenticjobs.com): Allows searching for remote jobs, and has a good filter function.

* [whoishiring](https://whoishiring.io/): Can filter remote jobs easily, and has other useful filtering functions.


#### Medium tier

* [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/): Can't really search for remote jobs specifically, have to use the search function that is not great.

* [indeed](https://www.indeed.com): Again must use the search function with something like "Remote Web Developer", not very efficient.

* [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/): There are a lot of jobs listed, but there is also a lot of comptetition, and clients tend to hire devs that live in poor countries that can work for very low pay, making it even harder to get hired.

#### Simple Lists of jobs (little or no additional functionalities like search filters)

* [WeWorkRemotely](https://weworkremotely.com/)

* [remoteok](https://remoteok.io/remote-dev-jobs)

* [remotejs](https://remotejs.co/)

* [remotejobr](https://remotejobr.com/)

* [remotepython](https://www.remotepython.com/): Python specific

#### Other
